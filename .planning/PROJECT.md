# ollog — Ham Radio Online Logbook

## What This Is

A self-hosted, ADIF-native, multi-operator logbook for amateur radio operators. Each operator maintains their own individual logbook identified by their callsign. Operators log QSOs in real-time via REST API or browser web UI, import/export full ADIF logbooks, and see each other's QSOs appear live in a shared station feed. All QSO data is stored using native ADIF field names, enabling seamless round-trip import/export with external logging tools. Each operator has a profile with personal info, station details, and grid location — auto-stamped onto every new QSO they log. Complete operator and admin documentation is available at `/guide` (deployment guide, operator walkthrough, API reference, ADIF field reference, troubleshooting).

## Core Value

Multiple operators can log QSOs simultaneously under their own callsigns without conflicts or data loss — the shared platform stays out of their way and just works.

## Shipped: v2.6 llms.txt Support (2026-04-25)

**Goal achieved:** `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` endpoints added to operator app; static files editable without touching Python; full 610-line LLM reference document covering all 16 REST endpoints with curl examples, ADIF field reference tables, and operator getting-started walkthrough.

## Current Milestone: v2.7 UTC Date/Time Entry

**Goal:** Upgrade the Log QSO form with live UTC date/time defaults, lock/unlock toggles, HHMMSS precision, and post-submission reset behavior control.

**Target features:**
- Date field locked to today's UTC (YYYYMMDD) by default; lock icon (16×16) toggles manual editing; `readonly` (not `disabled`) so value still submits; validated input
- Time field auto-updates with live UTC (HHMMSS) while locked; lock icon stops auto-update for manual entry; HHMM input normalized to HHMM00; validated
- DB accepts and stores HHMMSS; idempotent startup migration updates existing HHMM records to HHMM00
- Post-submission toggle: "Keep current date/time" (preserve values + lock state) vs "Reset to live UTC" (restore locked auto-updating defaults)

- ✓ Backup file downloads directly to the browser on demand — v2.0
- ✓ Backup filename includes UTC date and time timestamp (`ollog-backup-2026-04-14-15-30-42.gz`) — v2.0

### Validated (v2.1)

- ✓ Admin can upload a `.gz` backup file and restore the full database from it — v2.1
- ✓ System validates the backup file integrity (gzip decompressibility + NDJSON format) before attempting any restore — v2.1
- ✓ Admin must re-enter their password in a confirmation modal before the destructive overwrite proceeds — v2.1
- ✓ System auto-backs up the current database before wiping, so recovery is possible if the restore fails — v2.1

### Validated (v2.2)

- ✓ UDP datagrams containing an OPERATOR field are routed to that operator's log — multiple operators can send ADIF via UDP simultaneously without sharing a single UDP_OPERATOR account — v2.2
- ✓ Operator routing uses an in-memory callsign→User cache (no per-datagram MongoDB round-trip) — v2.2
- ✓ Unrecognized OPERATOR callsigns are dropped with a WARNING log — v2.2
- ✓ UDP_OPERATOR env var is an optional fallback — if absent and datagram has no OPERATOR field, QSO is dropped with WARNING — v2.2

### Validated (v2.3)

- ✓ Operator can view a dedicated statistics page at `/log/stats` linked from the sidebar nav — v2.3
- ✓ Stats page shows a pie chart of QSO count by band — v2.3
- ✓ Stats page shows a pie chart of QSO count by mode — v2.3

- ✓ Stats page shows an empty-state message when the operator has no QSOs logged — v2.3
- ✓ Charts adapt to dark/light theme toggle without a page reload (re-initialized on theme change) — v2.3

### Out of Scope

- Award tracking (DXCC, WAS, WAZ, etc.) — deferred to v2
- Self-registration — admin controls all operator accounts
- Real-time chat or club coordination features — not core to logging
- Mobile native app — web UI is responsive, no native app in v1
- LoTW/eQSL direct upload — TQSL certificate management adds significant operational complexity (v2)
- Callsign lookup (QRZ/HamQTH) — external API dependency with subscription/rate-limit friction (v2)
- MY_LAT / MY_LON in ADIF export — ADIF Location format is non-trivial (XDDD MM.MMM); lat/lon stored as float internally for future use
- DXCC entity / CQ zone / ITU zone derivation from callsign — requires cty.dat lookup (v2)
- Per-activation fields (MY_SOTA_REF, MY_POTA_REF) — session-level overrides, deferred (v2)
- Multiple station profiles per operator — deferred (v2)

### Validated (v2.4 — Phase 44)

- ✓ The SSE change-stream watcher survives a Jinja2 render exception and continues broadcasting subsequent change events (LIVE-01a)
- ✓ The watcher task is stored in `app.state.watcher_task` (strong reference) — Python 3.12+ GC cannot reclaim it (LIVE-01b)
- ✓ A QSO document with `qso_date_utc=None` does not kill the watcher (LIVE-01c)
- ✓ The LIVE indicator does NOT turn green on bare SSE connection open (`htmx:sseOpen`) (LIVE-02)
- ✓ The LIVE indicator turns green only after the first `htmx:sseMessage` with `type='new_qso'` is received (LIVE-02)
- ✓ The LIVE indicator shows OFFLINE on `htmx:sseError` and hides on `htmx:sseClose` (LIVE-02)

### Validated (v2.4 — Phase 45)

- ✓ `User.notify_sound: bool = False` field on User model — off by default, no migration needed (SND-03)
- ✓ `ProfileUpdateRequest` and `ProfileResponse` both include `notify_sound: bool = False`
- ✓ Profile Settings page shows a "Sound Notifications" checkbox, unchecked by default (SND-04)
- ✓ Sound preference persists per-operator via `update_profile()` → MongoDB `$set` (SND-05)

### Validated (v2.5 — Phase 48)

- ✓ QSO records are automatically stamped with `_created_at` (UTC datetime) via `default_factory` when first inserted — applies to REST API, UI, UDP, and ADIF import paths with no service-layer changes required (TS-01)
- ✓ `_created_at` is stripped from PATCH/update handlers in both REST API and UI routers so it is never overwritten after initial insert (TS-02)
- ✓ MongoDB compound index `operator_created_at_idx` on `(_operator ASC, _created_at DESC)` is declared in `QSO.Settings.indexes` and synced at app startup via Beanie `init_beanie()` (TS-03)
- ✓ `_created_at` is excluded from REST API `GET /api/qsos` responses (popped in `_qso_to_dict`) and from ADIF `.adi` export files (`_SKIP_FIELDS`)
- ✓ Pre-existing QSO documents that lack `_created_at` are backfilled from their ObjectId timestamp at app startup via `backfill_created_at()` idempotent migration

### Validated (v2.4 — Phase 47)

- ✓ When new QSOs arrive while the operator is on page 2+ or has active filters, a "N new QSO(s)" indigo pill badge appears above the log table — counter increments with each SSE event, singular/plural text correct (LIVE-03)
- ✓ Clicking the badge dismisses it and resets the counter to zero — no page jump, no auto-scroll (LIVE-04)
- ✓ Badge is a DOM sibling of #log-table so HTMX SSE innerHTML swaps cannot destroy it — badge survives all page navigations (LIVE-03)
- ✓ Badge auto-dismisses when operator navigates to page 1 with no filters (htmx:afterSettle + auto-refresh-ok sentinel) (LIVE-03)

### Validated (v2.4 — Phase 46)

- ✓ `log_view()` uses `get_current_user_cookie` and injects `notify_sound` into Jinja2 context (SND-01)
- ✓ `const NOTIFY_SOUND = "true"/"false"` rendered server-side in `log.html` — Python bool → JS string (SND-01)
- ✓ Web Audio API 440 Hz synthesized tone plays on `new_qso` SSE event when sound enabled (SND-01)
- ✓ Lazy `AudioContext` created on first user gesture; tone silent before interaction (SND-02)
- ✓ No external audio files — tone is synthesized client-side via `OscillatorNode` + `GainNode` (SND-01)

### Validated (v2.5 — Phase 49)

- ✓ Invalid sort fields (e.g. `_deleted`, `hashed_password`) passed to `get_qso_page()` fall back to `-qso_date_utc` — never reach MongoDB (SORT-04)
- ✓ All 10 allowed sort values (`-qso_date_utc`, `qso_date_utc`, `-CALL`, `CALL`, `-BAND`, `BAND`, `-MODE`, `MODE`, `-_created_at`, `_created_at`) are accepted without fallback (SORT-04)
- ✓ WARNING log emitted containing both the rejected field name and the operator callsign (SORT-04)
- ✓ View dict returned by `_qso_to_view_dict()` contains a `created_at` key with a datetime value (Phase 50 template consumption)
- ✓ SSE auto-refresh sentinel fires for both `-qso_date_utc` and `-_created_at` sorts on page 1 with no filters (SORT-03)
- ✓ SSE auto-refresh sentinel does NOT fire for non-newest-first sorts like `CALL` (SORT-03)

### Validated (v2.5 — Phase 50)

- ✓ MODE column header is clickable and sorts ascending on first click (`?sort=MODE`), descending on second click (`?sort=-MODE`) — SORT-01
- ✓ Clock icon in DATE header sorts by `_created_at` descending on first click (`?sort=-_created_at`), ascending on second click — SORT-02
- ✓ All inactive sortable columns (DATE text, clock icon, CALL, BAND, MODE) display a faint hollow double-chevron (`opacity-30 dark:opacity-25`) — UX-01
- ✓ Active sort column displays a solid directional chevron (down for desc, up for asc) — UX-02
- ✓ All sort clicks preserve active filter parameters (call, band, mode, date_from, date_to) in the URL — UX-01
- ✓ DATE header restructured with flex wrapper: date sort link + clock icon sort link side-by-side — D-01
- ✓ Non-sortable columns (Freq MHz, RST S/R, Actions) have no sort indicators — UX-01

### Validated (v2.6 — Phase 51)

- ✓ `GET /llms.txt` serves `static/llms.txt` with `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`, `include_in_schema=False` (LLMS-01, LLMS-04)
- ✓ `GET /llms-full.txt` serves `static/llms-full.txt` with `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`, `include_in_schema=False` (LLMS-02, LLMS-04)
- ✓ `static/llms.txt` contains title, one-sentence description, and section links to `/llms-full.txt` (LLMS-03)
- ✓ `static/llms-full.txt` contains complete API reference (all 16 REST endpoints with curl examples), ADIF field reference tables, and operator getting-started walkthrough (CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03)
- ✓ Both routes are absent from `/openapi.json` (LLMS-04)

### Validated (v2.7 — Phase 52)

- ✓ `normalize_time_on()` idempotent startup migration in `app/main.py` pads all 4-digit `TIME_ON` values to 6-digit `HHMM00` using anchored regex `^\d{4}$` filter + aggregation pipeline (DB-01)
- ✓ Migration called in `lifespan()` immediately after `backfill_created_at()` — runs on every startup, modifies 0 documents if already migrated (idempotent) (DB-01)
- ✓ `parse_adif_datetime()` in `app/qso/service.py` confirmed to accept both HHMM (4-digit) and HHMMSS (6-digit) `TIME_ON` — unchanged, test-covered (DB-02)
- ✓ `tests/test_migration.py` — 5 tests: padding, idempotency, skip-6-digit (integration), HHMM/HHMMSS parse acceptance (unit) (DB-01, DB-02)

### Validated (v2.7 — Phase 53)

- ✓ Log QSO form: QSO_DATE and TIME_ON wrapped in padlock UI — `readonly` by default, closed-padlock SVG, locked CSS; click toggles editable with open-padlock icon and aria-label swap (DATE-02, DATE-03, TIME-03)
- ✓ Live UTC clock: `initDateTime()` populates both fields on load using `getUTC*` exclusively; `setInterval` ticks TIME_ON every second while locked; `initDateTime()` resets icons/aria-labels on post-submit reset (DATE-01, TIME-01, TIME-02)
- ✓ HHMM normalization: `htmx:beforeRequest` pads 4-digit unlocked TIME_ON to 6 digits before validation fires (TIME-04)
- ✓ Locked-field validation: `validate()` skips `readonly` fields; TIME_ON range regex `^([01]\d|2[0-3])([0-5]\d)([0-5]\d)$` rejects out-of-range values client-side (DATE-04, TIME-05)
- ✓ Reset-mode toggle: pill widget in submit row; `localStorage` key `ollog.resetMode` persists choice across reloads (RESET-01)
- ✓ Post-submit branching: "Reset to live UTC" replays `form.reset()` + `initDateTime()`; "Keep current date/time" preserves all field state; both modes clear CALL and focus it (RESET-02, RESET-03)
- ✓ Clear button: `form.addEventListener('reset', ...)` defers `initDateTime()` via `setTimeout(0)` so date/time repopulate instead of going blank

**Database:** MongoDB 7 (single-node replica set for change streams)
**Auth:** PyJWT + pwdlib Argon2; HTTP-only cookie auth for UI/SSE, Bearer token for REST API, `X-API-Key` for REST API (v1.7+), `admin_token` cookie for admin UI (v1.8+)
**Codebase:** ~9,000+ LOC Python (+ HTML templates + Tailwind component system) + 7-page MkDocs docs site (pre-built `site/` in Docker image)

**Shipped features (cumulative, v1.0–v2.5 complete):**
All v2.4 features plus (Phases 48–50 complete):
- `app/qso/models.py` — `created_at: datetime` field with `alias="_created_at"`, `serialization_alias="_created_at"`, `default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc)`; `operator_created_at_idx` compound index `(_operator ASC, _created_at DESC)` added as 4th entry in `Settings.indexes`
- `app/qso/router.py` — PATCH handler strips `_created_at`/`created_at` from update body; `_qso_to_dict` pops `_created_at` from API responses
- `app/qso/ui_router.py` — PATCH handler strips `_created_at`/`created_at` from update body; `_qso_to_view_dict()` exposes `"created_at": qso.created_at` for template use
- `app/adif/router.py` — `_created_at` added to `_SKIP_FIELDS` to exclude from ADIF exports
- `app/main.py` — `backfill_created_at()` idempotent startup migration: stamps `_created_at` from ObjectId timestamp on pre-existing documents lacking the field
- `app/qso/service.py` — `_ALLOWED_SORT_FIELDS` frozenset (10 values), `_DEFAULT_SORT` constant, guard block in `get_qso_page()` with WARNING log for invalid sort fields (prevents MongoDB field enumeration)
- `templates/log/log_table.html` — SSE auto-refresh sentinel extended to fire on `-_created_at` sort; MODE sort header (ascending-first); DATE header restructured with flex wrapper (date sort + clock icon sort); CALL/BAND/MODE/clock inactive hollow chevron indicators; `dark:opacity-25` for dark mode faint indicators
- `static/css/output.css` — rebuilt with `dark:opacity-25` class
- `tests/test_qso_schema.py` — 7 new/updated tests: index count, field alias, default_factory, MongoDB storage, compound index existence, PATCH immutability, backfill correctness and idempotency
- `tests/test_watcher.py` — updated lifespan mock to include `backfill_created_at`
- `tests/test_service_sort.py` — SORT-04 allowlist validation tests
- `tests/test_sse_sentinel.py` — SORT-03 sentinel integration tests
- `tests/test_view_dict.py` — view dict `created_at` key presence and type test

**Known tech debt:**
- `QSO.find_active()` in models.py — dead production code
- `from_mongo_dt()` in utils.py — tested, not called in production
- Docker end-to-end verification pending (requires live Docker environment)

**Known tech debt:**
- `QSO.find_active()` in models.py — dead production code
- `from_mongo_dt()` in utils.py — tested, not called in production
- Docker end-to-end verification pending (requires live Docker environment)

## Context

- **ADIF Spec:** https://adif.org/317/ADIF_317.htm — all QSO fields conform to ADIF 3.1.7 (MY_ANTENNA confirmed as correct field name per 3.1.6)
- **Domain:** Ham radio operators log "QSOs" (contacts) — each QSO captures callsign, frequency/band, mode (CW, SSB, FT8, etc.), signal reports (RST), date, time, and optional fields
- **ADIF file format:** Tag-based encoding `<CALL:4>W1AW <BAND:3>20M <EOR>` — lossless import/export is non-negotiable
- **Simultaneous logging:** Club station or contest team with multiple operators active at the same time

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Python backend, MongoDB for storage
- **ADIF Version**: ADIF 3.1.7
- **Deployment**: Self-hosted (Docker Compose) or cloud without code changes — twelve-factor config
- **Auth**: Admin-managed accounts only — no public self-registration endpoint

| Individual logs per operator | Each ham has their own callsign and logbook identity | ✓ Good — operator as leading index key enables efficient per-operator queries |
| ADIF field names as internal data model | Eliminates translation layer; stays spec-compliant | ✓ Good — model_extra stores arbitrary ADIF fields losslessly |
| Admin-managed accounts | Prevents unauthorized access; club/team deployments | ✓ Good — admin bootstrap from env vars; no web signup endpoint |
| MongoDB for QSO storage | Flexible schema fits ADIF's large optional field set | ✓ Good — Beanie ODM + pymongo async works well |
| pymongo AsyncMongoClient (not Motor) | pymongo 4.9+ has native async; Motor is a redundant wrapper | ✓ Good — Motor EOL confirmed May 2025 |
| Shared `qsos` collection with `_operator` leading index | Per-operator collections add operational complexity | ✓ Good — compound index efficient; operator isolation enforced at query layer |
| Unique compound index dropped (03-02) | Soft-delete re-insertion and force=true use cases broke unique constraint | ✓ Good — app-level find_duplicate() is the enforcement mechanism |
| SSE over WebSockets for live feed | Unidirectional broadcast, HTMX-native, works through proxies | ✓ Good — htmx-ext-sse 2.2.4 + FastAPI native EventSourceResponse |
| MongoDB single-node replica set | Change streams require oplog; single node sufficient for self-hosted | ✓ Good — self-initiating healthcheck pattern works reliably |
| Cookie auth for SSE endpoint | Browser EventSource API cannot send Authorization headers | ✓ Good — get_current_operator_callsign_cookie used on /feed/station |
| directConnection=true in test fixtures | Enables test fixtures to connect to replica set node directly | ✓ Good — works for both standalone and replica set environments |
| Profile fields embedded in User document | No separate collection, no migration required | ✓ Good — Optional fields default to None; existing users unaffected |
| grid-to-latlon conversion in service layer (not model) | Keeps User model as plain data; separation of concerns | ✓ Good — update_profile() in service.py handles lat/lon sync |
| center=True for maidenhead grid conversion | SW corner default causes up to 80 km error | ✓ Good — grid_to_latlon() uses center of grid square |
| MY_ANTENNA (not MY_ANT) field name | ADIF 3.1.6 spec lists MY_ANTENNA — my_ant was a placeholder | ✓ Good — renamed in 08-01; no migration needed (Optional, no production data) |
| STATION_CALLSIGN omitted (not empty string) when blank | Empty string causes LoTW/POTA upload failures | ✓ Good — schema validator normalizes "" → None |
| ADIF import path excluded from auto-stamping | Historical records must be preserved as-is | ✓ Good — profile param defaults to None; import callers pass no profile |
| UI profile POST calls service directly (not /api/profile) | Avoids internal HTTP round-trip; follows existing UI route pattern | ✓ Good — consistent with how submit_qso calls build_qso_dict |
| User.model_construct() in stamping unit tests | Beanie Document() requires DB init; model_construct() bypasses it | ✓ Good — enables fast synchronous unit tests without MongoDB |
| Truncated bisect comparison for ITU range lookup | ITU ranges use letter keys (WAA-WZZ); callsigns have digits (W1AW); ASCII digits sort before letters — exact comparison fails | ✓ Good — compare start[:n] <= prefix <= end[:n]; all 28 tests pass |
| `_NOTFOUND` sentinel in range lookup | iso=None is valid (non-country entity); need to distinguish "range found, iso=None" from "no range found" | ✓ Good — object() sentinel prevents 4U1ITU from falling through to shorter prefix match |
| Digit presence required in callsign | `UNKNOWN` resolves to Kazakhstan via UNA-UQZ range; all valid callsigns contain a digit | ✓ Good — validation rejects digit-free strings before lookup |
| `iso.lower()` before flag path construction | `lookup_prefix` returns "US" but SVG files are named "us.svg" | ✓ Good — .lower() in _qso_to_view_dict(); flag_iso always lowercase |
| `git mv app/static/flags static/flags` for flag serving | StaticFiles mounts root `static/` at `/static`; `app/static/flags/` was unreachable | ✓ Good — 271 SVG files now at `static/flags/`, served at `/static/flags/*.svg` |
| Render-time flag enrichment in `_qso_to_view_dict()` | Single injection point for all 4 render paths; prefix allocations can change — not stored in QSO | ✓ Good — no schema change; enrichment transparent to all existing render paths |
| QSOResponse uses `Field(alias='_operator'/'_deleted')` | `_qso_to_dict()` uses `model_dump(by_alias=True)` — response model must declare aliases to pass validation | ✓ Good — `populate_by_name=True` + `extra='ignore'` handles both construction and arbitrary ADIF passthrough |
| `extra='ignore'` on QSOResponse | Arbitrary ADIF `model_extra` fields must not cause 500 validation errors | ✓ Good — silently drops extra fields at response serialization boundary |
| Export annotated with `responses=` (not `response_model=`) | `StreamingResponse` body cannot be Pydantic-validated | ✓ Good — `response_class=StreamingResponse` + `responses={200: {"content": {"text/plain": {}}}}` |
| Feed/HTMX routers excluded from OpenAPI (`include_in_schema=False`) | `/feed/station` uses cookie auth — cannot be exercised from Swagger UI | ✓ Good — clean `/docs` with REST-only endpoints |
| `site_url` in mkdocs.yml ends with `/guide/` (trailing slash) | Sub-path serving without trailing slash generates broken relative asset URLs | ✓ Good — CSS/JS assets resolve correctly at `/guide` |
| `site/` committed to repo; `COPY site/ site/` in Dockerfile | No MkDocs in production image; no CI pipeline needed | ✓ Good — pre-built docs served directly from static files |
| `/guide` StaticFiles mount registered before `/static` with `html=True` | Mount order is load-bearing in FastAPI; `html=True` enables automatic `index.html` serving | ✓ Good — `/guide` serves MkDocs index at directory paths |
| SECRET_KEY signs JWTs only; Argon2 password hashing is independent | Clearing cookies (not resetting passwords) fixes most login-after-restart issues | ✓ Good — documented clearly in troubleshooting |
| ADIF import has no `force=true` | Bulk re-import requires delete-then-import; single QSO creation supports `force=true` | ✓ Good — documented in troubleshooting and API reference |
| `UDP_OPERATOR` config for operator identity (not JWT in datagrams) | JWTs expire with no UDP refresh path; overnight FT8 sessions would silently stop logging | ✓ Good — config-pinned identity prevents spoofing; works for long-running unattended sessions |
| Default UDP port 2399 | Port 2237 (WSJT-X) and 12060 (N1MM+) are ecosystem-occupied; dedicated port avoids silent conflict | ✓ Good — no conflicts with common ham radio logging software |
| `UDP_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1` default (loopback) | Protects against LAN exposure by default; matches ham radio ecosystem convention | ✓ Good — operators opt in to LAN exposure by setting `0.0.0.0` |
| `UDP_ENABLED=false` default | Existing deployments unaffected on upgrade | ✓ Good — clean opt-in; no surprise socket on upgrade |
| `asyncio.DatagramProtocol` (stdlib) | No new production dependencies; runs on uvicorn's event loop | ✓ Good — zero new deps; transport.close() is synchronous (never awaited) |
| `build_qso_dict(profile=user)` called directly (not `import_qsos_from_bytes`) | `import_qsos_from_bytes` omits `profile=` parameter, breaking auto-stamping for UDP path | ✓ Good — UDP QSOs get identical profile stamping to REST API QSOs |
| Operator `User` document cached once at startup | Avoids MongoDB round-trip per datagram | ✓ Good — WARNING logged if UDP_OPERATOR callsign not found in DB |
| `_background_tasks` set + `add_done_callback(discard)` for create_task | Python 3.12+ GCs tasks without strong references; Ruff RUF006 confirms this is required | ✓ Good — tasks complete reliably under burst load |
| Merge parse_errors + no-records into single WARNING branch | Two separate WARNING paths produced double-logging for binary garbage input; criterion required exactly one | ✓ Good — `if parse_errors or not records:` single guard satisfies "exactly one WARNING" |
| Structured `disposition=accepted|rejected|duplicate` log tokens | Operators need grep-able logs to diagnose UDP path in production | ✓ Good — `src=IP:PORT call=CALLSIGN disposition=` on every outcome branch |

| `htmx:sseMessage` listener instead of `hx-trigger="sse:event [condition]"` | JS filter evaluation on SSE hx-trigger had only MEDIUM confidence from research (inferred from htmx source, not documented) | ✓ Good — event listener approach is fully reliable and equally concise |
| SSE attributes on `#log-table` container (not inside `log_table.html` partial) | `#log-table` is the HTMX swap target — its innerHTML is replaced but the element persists; SSE attrs inside the partial would be destroyed on every pagination/filter/sort swap | ✓ Good — SSE connection survives all navigation |
| Server-side `#auto-refresh-ok` hidden sentinel span | Client-side JS cannot evaluate server-side predicates (page number, active filters); server renders marker only at page 1 + default sort + no filters; client checks `getElementById` | ✓ Good — single source of truth; marker disappears atomically on any navigation |
| `#log-table input` selector for edit-row guard | `qso_row_edit.html` renders `<tr>` with NO `.editing` class — the prior research assumption was wrong; input presence is the correct discriminator | ✓ Good — catches any open edit row without relying on a CSS class convention |
| `jwt_expire_minutes` default raised 60 → 480 | Overnight FT8 sessions run 8+ hours; 60-min default would expire mid-SSE-connection, silently breaking live log table feature | ✓ Good — existing env var mechanism unchanged; operators can still override |
| FOUC IIFE placed before `<link rel=stylesheet>` in `<head>` | Class applied synchronously before any CSS loads; any other position (deferred, external file, after link) causes visible white flash | ✓ Good — zero flash on cold page load across Chrome, Firefox, Safari |
| rAF-rAF pattern for transition suppression | Inject `.no-transition` before adding `dark` class, remove after two animation frames — prevents color-fade on load while preserving user-initiated toggle animation | ✓ Good — smooth toggle, no load animation |
| `document.body` htmx:afterSettle listener (not `document`) | Matches existing HTMX event patterns in codebase; body is the correct target for afterSettle | ✓ Good — theme icon stays in sync after all HTMX swaps |
| `.glass-card` uses raw `-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` (not `@apply backdrop-blur-md`) | `@apply backdrop-blur-md` generates `backdrop-filter: var(--tw-backdrop-blur)` — Safari pre-18.0 ignores `-webkit-backdrop-filter` with variable references; fixed pixel values are the only reliable path | ✓ Good — frosted glass renders in Safari and all major browsers |
| `postcss.config.js` with `autoprefixer({ remove: false })` | Default autoprefixer silently strips manually-added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` during Tailwind build — build artifact was missing the prefix until this was discovered | ✓ Good — `-webkit-backdrop-filter` survives every build |
| FastAPI sub-app (`admin_main.py`) requires its own `StaticFiles` mount | Main app `StaticFiles` mount does not propagate to sub-apps; admin was 404-ing on `/static/css/output.css` until this was added | ✓ Good — each FastAPI sub-app is isolated; mount must be explicit |
| Canvas/surface token classes as literal strings in templates (not Jinja expressions) | Tailwind purge scanner reads template files as text — dynamic class construction (e.g. `class="{{ dark_class }}"`) is invisible to the scanner; new `dark:` classes dropped from output.css | ✓ Good — all tokens present in output.css |
| `{% block sidebar_class %}{% endblock %}` in `<aside>` class attribute | Minimal-invasive extension point; empty default block adds no whitespace artifact; `users.html` injects `dark:bg-surface-dark` as a literal string for Tailwind scanner | ✓ Good — admin sidebar dark surface without touching base_app.html for every template |
| `asyncio.to_thread(_write_backup, settings)` (sync helper, not async run_backup) | `asyncio.to_thread` requires a sync callable — passing the `async def run_backup` silently returns a coroutine object instead of a Path; extracted `_write_backup` sync helper is the correct target | ✓ Good — event loop unblocked during all MongoDB + gzip I/O |
| Plain `<a href>` anchor for download button (no `hx-*` attributes) | HTMX intercepts XHR responses — `Content-Disposition: attachment` is silently ignored and binary payload discarded; plain anchor causes browser-native navigation that HTMX does not intercept | ✓ Good — file save dialog fires correctly; confirmed no `hx-boost` on `<body>` in base_app.html |
| Per-page `{% block sidebar_nav %}` override in admin templates | Each admin page owns its entire sidebar nav block with both links and correct active state — avoids fragile conditional logic in base_app.html | ✓ Good — Operators page shows Operators active; Backup page shows Backup active |
| FileResponse filename from `backup_path.stem` (not a second datetime call) | Guarantees download filename matches actual file on disk; eliminates clock skew between generation and naming | ✓ Good — `ollog-backup-{stem}.gz` always matches the file returned |
| `bson.json_util.loads` (not `json.loads`) for restore deserialization | `json.loads` silently corrupts ObjectId as `{"$oid":"..."}` dict — BSON types must round-trip correctly | ✓ Good — ObjectId, datetime, and all BSON extended types restored with correct Python types |
| Auto-backup runs before any `db.drop()` in `restore_confirm` | OPS-01 safety requirement: if restore fails mid-wipe, the pre-restore backup filename is included in the error response so admin can recover | ✓ Good — failure response always includes auto-backup path |
| Path traversal guard: `resolve(temp_path).startswith(gettempdir())` + `.gz` suffix + `.exists()` | All three checks required before any file read — prevents directory traversal attacks on the temp file path in the hidden form field | ✓ Good — three-layer guard; any missing check is a security hole |
| All HTMX error fragments return HTTP 200 | HTMX 2.x silently drops response body on 4xx — error HTML would never appear in the UI | ✓ Good — all five fragment templates return 200 with HTMX-consumable error HTML |
| `#restore-modal` div is a sibling of `#restore-result` (not nested in form) | Cancel button targets `#restore-modal` with `hx-swap="outerHTML"` — element must be independently addressable in the DOM | ✓ Good — modal clears cleanly; upload form and result div unaffected |
| GET `/admin/ui/restore` returns bare `<div id="restore-modal"></div>` on HTMX request | Cancel button fires `hx-get="/admin/ui/restore"` — dual-render pattern returns empty div to clear modal without page reload | ✓ Good — modal dismissal is a pure DOM swap; no data lost |
| `.modal-backdrop` uses raw `-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` (not `@apply`) | Consistent with glass-card Safari fix: fixed pixel values required; CSS variable references ignored by Safari | ✓ Good — backdrop blur renders across Safari, Chrome, Firefox |
| `get_pymongo_collection()` (not `get_motor_collection()`) for raw MongoDB aggregation | Motor was EOL'd May 2025; Beanie now exposes `get_pymongo_collection()` as the official raw-collection accessor | ✓ Good — correct API; Motor import would fail in current dependency set |
| `(await collection.aggregate(pipeline)).to_list()` double-await pattern | `AsyncCollection.aggregate()` is a coroutine returning a cursor — must await it to get the cursor, then call `.to_list()` | ✓ Good — single-await pattern silently returned a coroutine object instead of results |
| `unique_entity_count` computed from `iso_seen` set before top-8 truncation | Scalar must reflect total distinct entities worked, not just the visible top-8 slice | ✓ Good — count is accurate regardless of "Other" grouping |
| Chart.js 4.5.1 UMD bundle via jsDelivr CDN, loaded only in `{% block extra_scripts %}` override | ESM-only build fails silently; CDN avoids bundling; loading in base.html penalizes all pages with Chart.js parse cost | ✓ Good — stats page loads Chart.js; all other pages unaffected |
| `themechange` CustomEvent broadcast from `toggleTheme()` (zero-coupling) | `toggleTheme()` does not know about charts; event listener pattern lets any future chart page opt in independently | ✓ Good — pattern established; any future chart page just adds `window.addEventListener('themechange', ...)` |
| `{% if total_qsos > 0 %}{% block extra_scripts %}...{% endblock %}{% endif %}` conditional block | Prevents Chart.js script tag from loading on empty-state render; Jinja2 evaluates block declarations at parse time so the conditional only guards render-time output | ✓ Good — no Chart.js CDN request on empty log |
| `app.state.watcher_task` strong reference (not local variable) | Python 3.12+ GCs asyncio tasks without a strong reference; local variable in lifespan `yield` block is not sufficient | ✓ Good — watcher task survives GC cycles between event loop ticks |
| `try/except Exception` in watch_qsos inner loop (not outer) | Catching at the inner loop level lets the watcher continue after a single bad event; outer-level catch would restart the entire change stream | ✓ Good — watcher survives Jinja2 render errors and null-field documents |
| `eventsFlowing` sentinel for LIVE indicator (not sseOpen) | `htmx:sseOpen` fires when the HTTP connection opens, before any events flow; green on open is premature and misleading when the watcher is unhealthy | ✓ Good — indicator only turns green after first confirmed `new_qso` event |
| `NOTIFY_SOUND` as Jinja2 string `"true"/"false"` (not Python bool) | Python `True`/`False` renders as `"True"`/`"False"` in templates — JS strict comparison `=== "true"` would silently fail | ✓ Good — explicit string rendering with `'true' if x else 'false'` pattern |
| Sound check fires BEFORE auto-refresh-ok guard in htmx:sseMessage | Badge and tone should work on page 2+ and with active filters — placing sound/badge logic after the `return` guard would silence them on all non-page-1 views | ✓ Good — tone and badge both work on page 2+ and filtered views |
| `#new-qso-badge` as DOM sibling of `#log-table` (not child) | HTMX SSE innerHTML swap replaces all children of the swap target; badge nested inside would be destroyed on every SSE refresh | ✓ Good — badge persists across all HTMX SSE swaps and pagination |
| `classList.remove('hidden')` before `classList.add('flex')` for badge show | Tailwind `hidden` compiles to `display: none !important`; adding `flex` without removing `hidden` has no visible effect | ✓ Good — badge appears correctly on first increment |

## Evolution

2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
