# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Multiple operators can log QSOs simultaneously under their own callsigns without conflicts or data loss
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Foundation: ADIF field names stored verbatim as MongoDB document keys — no translation layer, no snake_case mapping
- Foundation: Shared `qsos` collection with `_operator` as leading field in all compound indexes (not per-operator collections)
- Foundation: All datetimes UTC-aware codebase-wide; re-attach UTC tzinfo after every MongoDB read via utility function
- Foundation: Compound unique index on {_operator, CALL, qso_date_utc, BAND, MODE} + upsert=True for concurrent duplicate safety

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Verify ADIF library maintainership on PyPI (`adif-io`, `adif3`) before choosing library vs. custom parser — custom parser (~100 lines) may be preferable given parser correctness requirements
- Phase 4: Decide async import job queue (FastAPI BackgroundTasks vs. Celery + Redis) before Phase 4 planning — Redis adds operational dependency for self-hosted deployments
- Phase 5: Research FastAPI WebSocket vs. SSE for multi-operator live feed; verify Beanie/Motor change stream support
