# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-20)

**Core value:** Multiple operators can log QSOs simultaneously under their own callsigns without conflicts or data loss
**Current focus:** Milestone v2.5 — QSO Sorting & Entry Timestamp

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-04-20 — Milestone v2.5 started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (historical):**

- Total plans completed: 61 plans across v1.0–v2.3

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v2.5 milestone started: QSO Sorting & Entry Timestamp

### Critical Build Rules (carried forward)

- **FOUC prevention:** The inline IIFE in `base.html` `<head>` is load-bearing. Never move it, add `defer`/`async`, or extract it to an external file.
- **Tailwind purge:** New `dark:` classes must appear as complete literal strings in scanned template files. Always run `npm run build` + grep verification for new classes before committing templates or `input.css`.
- **Safari backdrop-filter:** Declare `-webkit-backdrop-filter` explicitly in `@layer components` for glass card classes. Use fixed pixel values, not CSS variable references.
- **PostCSS autoprefixer:** Always configure `postcss.config.js` with `autoprefixer({ remove: false })` when writing explicit webkit prefixes in source CSS.
- **FastAPI sub-app StaticFiles:** Every FastAPI sub-app that serves HTML must have its own `StaticFiles` mount for `/static`. The main app mount does not propagate.
- **apscheduler<4 upper bound is load-bearing:** Do not touch `pyproject.toml` APScheduler constraints.

### Known Tech Debt

- `QSO.find_active()` in models.py — dead production code
- `from_mongo_dt()` in utils.py — tested, not called in production
- Docker end-to-end verification pending (requires live Docker environment)

### Pending Todos

None.
